Read the examples preferably in this order:
1)introduction
2)logicGates
3)process
4)if_else
5)when_else
6)testbench

    Note that it is best if you clone the parent folder and
modify every circuit as a project of your own in order not to
lose the template.

    One hint in order to run your tests in correct manner, try
to compile your hdl files without optimisation for the 
troubleshooting. transcript argument call is (-O0) example:
"vcom 'examplefile.vhd' -O0"
